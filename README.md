## 🧩 Problem It Solves

In regions where mobile money is central to daily transactions (like in Kenya), chat and payment apps are usually separate. NexaChat combines both, allowing users to:

- Chat in real-time
- Share media
- Send or request payments, all from one place

This helps streamline workflows for freelancers, small businesses, and teams needing integrated communication and payment functionality.
